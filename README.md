# Flask-ecommerce
 Institute project

This project started because we needed to develop an ecommerce site, for my computer institute, using python classes.
After the basic backbone was ready and working, I started adding a GUI and saw a good starting point in a tutorial made by David Adams (https://codeshack.io/login-system-python-flask-mysql/), after finishing the tutorial I continued adding more fields and changing the structure of the code to MVC.

The status of the project is the following:
- Implement the shopping cart GUI and the class with attributes and methods
- Make the catalog of products and the option to add items to the shopping cart
- Change the profile window to a more complete information page, where you can change some options
- Change how the shopping history looks
